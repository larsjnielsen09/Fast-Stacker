DIY cheap, fast, portable, and accurate automated macro focus stacking rail (based on Arduino microcontroller) 
which can be used with a wide range of photo cameras, and magnifications from standard macro (1:1) to extreme 
macro (up to 20:1). To reproduce this project, you need some basic mechanical and soldering skills. 
Once you have all the parts, it can be built in a couple of days.
